# Prework-Study-Guide
A study guide for course pre-work.
# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I decided to make a study guide to practice good study habits.
I built this project that I can look through my studies and implement what I learn in my code.
With the study guide, It helps to have what I learned in writing, so I don't forget everything that I read and learned through this course.
With creating this study guide, I've learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
